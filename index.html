            This is a personal project website I am using to
            learn html, css, and javascript as part of a
            full-stack developer training program.

                <p style="color: #d79921;">
                    So far, I have created a basic HTML structure, and added some basic in-line
                    CSS. I did create a style sheet that I will move the CSS to once it comes
                    up in my course. Although it is tempting, I do not want to jump too far
                    ahead.

                <p style="color: #d79921;">
                    Today I added links to other websites, placeholders. I added a poorly formatted
                    placeholder image to be a logo for the website. Although it hasn't come up in my
                    class yet, I added an unordered list as well. I added a link to the project license
                    in the footer.

                    Today I added an auto-playing local video file to the header. I am also going to embed a
                    Youtube video of the HTML tutorial that I am watching in conjunction with making this
                    website, which should be embedded below.

                <p style="color: #d79921;">
                    I have modified the list in the nav area to be a description list, and gave each nav link a
                    brief description. A new table is implemented that acts as a very basic roadmap of my progress
                    thus far.
